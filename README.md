# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The data for this project is taking from the link above:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
I create a Codebook that describes the variables in the data and the change that I made in order to clean up the data. I originate a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject which is called tidyData.txt.
