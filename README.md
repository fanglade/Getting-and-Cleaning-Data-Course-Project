##Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The data for this project is taking from the link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

I originate a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

1.	Create the working directory for the data set.

2.	Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

3.	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

4.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

5.	Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.

6.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject which is called tidyData.txt.

7.	 I create a Codebook that describes the variables in the data and the change that I made in order to clean up the data.
