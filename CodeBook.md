##Code Book
This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidyData.txt.The set of variables that were estimated from these signals that I used: mean(): Mean value std(): Standard deviation I create one R script called run_analysis.R. 

Identifiers

•	subject - The ID of the test subject.

•	activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken.

#Measurements
