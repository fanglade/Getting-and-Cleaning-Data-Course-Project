Code Book
This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidyData.txt.The set of variables that were estimated from these signals that I used: mean(): Mean value std(): Standard deviation I create one R script called run_analysis.R. 
Identifiers
•	subject - The ID of the test subject.
•	activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken.
Measurements
